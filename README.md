# Stackoverflow-Reputation-Builder
This was a project to learn jQuery AJAX patterns. In this project I implemented the get top-answerers section from stackexchange and then displayed it. This project uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, and Javascript. You can see this website in action at  https://jayzamazing.github.io/Stackoverflow-Reputation-Builder.
